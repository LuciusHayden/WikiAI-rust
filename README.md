This is WikiAI rewritten in rust (previously written in python (with less featuers))

so shockingly rust is not the language that any AI application should be written in. Because of this there are some limitations to what this API can do, its unfortunate but the whole purpose of this project was to get better at rust. 

I am happy with how it turned out, however my motivation to add more functionality to the UI is almost non-existant, some more functionality might be coming to the API but not to the UI


I used langchain-rust by Abraxas-365 for the AI operations, while it works fine, it doesnt have the same level of customizeability that it the official langchain does in python, due to this the actual use of the AI is debateable, however it works as inteded. 

the original WikiAI did was written in python but before I learned about langchain so its use is also negligible.
